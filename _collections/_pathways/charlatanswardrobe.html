type: Dynamic
time: 1857-1903
location: Europe - America
history: The Charlatans' Wardrobe was created by an unknown individual in 1857. It is unknown if the wardrobe's creator intended the wardrobe to be the boundary of a gate, or if the creator knew it housed one. The wardrobe was transported to America in 1889, where it was destroyed by a fire in 1903. 
aesthetic: The Charlatans' Wardrobe is a blaise wooden box about 6 feet tall and 4 feet wide. The door features a detailed painting and a single metal knob of a small faux diamond. The knob can be turned to one of 4 positions at any one time, but cannot be turned when the door is open.
specialty: Each of the knob's settings creates a connection to one of 3 other pathways; the forth position allows the wardrobe to function as a normal piece of furniture for storing coats.
