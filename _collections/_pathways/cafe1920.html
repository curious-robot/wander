specialty: Cafe 1920 offers direct, immediate access to its sister pathway location, Catacombe Cafe. Wanderers enter a secret door on the building's second story to emerge out of the same door exactly 90 years before. This pathway is one of the least restrictive, allowing almost any Traveler safe passage. It is one of the most famous and cherished pathways throughout the Axiomatic timeline.
