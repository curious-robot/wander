- Overview

Pathways, also known as gates, gateways, paths, portals, ways, and more, are complex upper-dimensional rifts that connect two or more points in spacetime. They are possible due to the folding of the dimension of time in 7 dimensional spacetime. It is unknown what exactly is required to create a pathway, as almost all gates are naturally occurring. However, a handful have been created through artificial means.

- Description

Paths come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, so it is impossible to universally describe them. However, for gateways to be used they must be bounded by physical matter. A pathway's boundary may be a doorway, a flat surface, an object, or even a liquid. If a pathway's boundary material is destroyed or significantly altered, the pathway will also be destroyed or become unusable. Paths bounded by unstable matter, like liquids, are inherently more unstable. 

- Functionality 

Any particular pathway only exists for a certain period of time, anywhere from a few seconds to many decades. During this time, a gateway can be accessed from and give access to other gateways to which it is connected. Each gate is governed by a unique set of rules about where users of the path will be sent upon entering, or how often it can be used, or by whom it can be used. 

-- Types

There are 3 basic types of pathways: Static, Dynamic, and Networks. Two connected static paths offer travel between each other exclusively. Ex: Catacombe Cafe and Cafe 1920. 

Dynamic paths are connected to more than one other gate, have changing connections, or can be manipulated by wanderers. Ex: the Charlatan's Wardrobe. 

Network gateways are connected to many, many other paths and can route travels to and from specific locations. Each network path is unique and specializes in a particular area; there are only 3 in the Axiomatic timeline. Ex: Hephaestus Research Facility.

Unstable paths are rare and dangerous. They are paths that offer no connections, negative time intervals, matter-reorganization, or other dangerous time related weirdness. 

-- Use 

On any normal object or entity, ways have no effect. Only sentient individuals known as "Wanderers" can actually access and use paths. Wanderers are entities who, for unknown reasons, are allowed to exist at multiple, non-consecutive points in time. Any one Wanderer can use particular paths to reach other points in time. Since Wanderers are not allowed to exist at every point in time, not all gates can be used by all Wanderers, as certain paths would lead would lead a Wanderer to an "illegal" section of time. Thus, these individuals typically try to acquire some form of technology that reads and displays when they are allowed to be, and ultimately, which pathways they can use. 

This makes getting from one point in time to a target destination rather difficult. To get from 21 century North America to 3rd century Europe, could, for example, involve taking a path to 20th century America, sailing to South America, using a path to travel to 30th century Antarctica, hiking over a mountain range to another portal leading to 18th century Europe, and finally another gate leading to 3rd century Scotland. Any one trip to a desired location could involve dozens of steps because gates are rare, widely dispersed, offer access to limited other gates, and because some gates may not be usable.
