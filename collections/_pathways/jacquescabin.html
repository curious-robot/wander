history:
aesthetic: "Jacque's Cabin", as it is most commonly known, is a cabin located in rural Quebec. The cabin belongs to a French fur trapper, obviously named Jacque. According to reliable sources, Jacque never knew of the presence of a pathway inside of his cabin. The cabin is sparsley decorated, all impliments being made from hand by Jacque, with an occasional item left  in memoria by a traveler. The cabin is often left unoccupied by its owner, allowing the occasional wanderers, who enter through the building's only window, a rural and rustic place to stay. 
specialty: The pathway inside Jacque's Cabin offers static access to the [WIP] gate.
