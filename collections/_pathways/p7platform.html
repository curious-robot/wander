history:
aesthetic: The P-7 Oil Platform is just what it sounds like, a semi-submerged oil platform located somewhere in the eastern Pacific ocean. The platform has been long decommissioned, and serves to openly advertise the pathway it houses. The platform features 4 tidal turbines and an array of solar cells that power 14 temporary lodging rooms located throughout the facility. Wanderers who find themselves in, or rather, on the P-7 Oil Platform often pay to stay in the relaxing and covetted rooms, each decorated in a different era's aesthetic.
specialty: The reason Wanderers often find themselves on P-7 for such extended periods of time relative to the pathway's rural and uneventful surroundings is due to a peculiarity of the path's mechanics. Travelers can access the P-7 gateway from any of 7 other gates. Each of these 7 paths corrosponds to a day of the week on which travelers arrive on the platform*. In turn, the P-7 pathway  offers access to exactly 7 gates. Each day of the week on P-7 determines which of these 7 gates a traveler will be routed to*. Thus, depending on the destination one is seeking, one may have a "lay-over" of several days on the platform. Hence, the lodging accommodations. * Time of day is determined by the local time at the entrance gate. Year and week are determined by unknown methods.
