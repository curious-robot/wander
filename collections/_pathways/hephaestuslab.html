history:
aesthetic: Hephaestus Research Facility is an emmense laboratory located in [REDACTED]. It is at this facility that time travel is first discovered. It houses one of only a handful of artificial gates, bounded only by a strictly regulated atmosphere and split into entrance and exit portals. The facility is comprised of a vast, above-ground university campus*, underground labyrinths dedicated to research, top-secret housing facilities for traveler-criminals and cross-timeline anomalies, and even temporary lodgings for weary travelers. *Hepaestus University is known for openly teaching time-travel sciences. 
specialty: As one of the most important hub pathways to date*, the Hephaestus Research Facility offers to connections to a myriad of pathways along the Axiomatic Timeline as well as a total of 11 connections to 5 alternate timelines. Entrance gates to the facility are few and usually heavily guarded by the Anvil Science Group. Arrival wanderers are quarantined until there origins and motives are determined. However, for a price, one can be routed by the facility's pathway to virtually any section of the timeline.
