history:
aesthetic: Thomas Dunbar is a citizen of the United States of America who was born on January 12, 1835. He is most remembered for fighting for the Union in the United States Civil War, in which he was killed in combat. 
specialty: "Tom" as he is known to friends and Wanderers, is the only known human to be the boundary of a Way. Travelers emerge from and enter the surface of Thomas' skin, or clothing if it is withing 5 cm of his skin. The process is painless for both parties, if not a little startling. Tom's path became active on March 23rd, 1858, when Thomas was 23, and was destroyed when he was killed on August 15th, 1864 in the Battle of Mobile Bay. Thomas is also documented as having the ability to sense the presence of Wanderers, and discern which paths a Traveler can use. Thomas can evidently determine the destination gate of his path if he can imagine it. If he cannot picture the destination, is unconscious, or is not concentrated, the destination is random.
