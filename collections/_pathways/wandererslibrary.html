history:
aesthetic: The Wanderers' Library is a timeloop located outside of all timelines. It appears as a vast library of indeterminate dimensions, hypothesisized to contain every book ever written in all timelines branching from the Axiomatic one. If so, the library would be virtually infinite in size. While most of the space is filled with shelves ranging in height from a few feet to miles high, other areas of the library include courtyards, gardens, zoos, hotel rooms, houses, and more. While there are many walls inside the building, it is impossible to locate external walls and actually exit the library. Egress is only possible through exit gates that lead back into a regular timeline.
specialty: All visitors to the Wanderers' Library emergy from a large globe in the "Center Hall", presumably the center of the library. There are a myriad of exit portals located in various nooks and crannies throughout the shelves, bounded by doors, statues, pools, walls, and often by the books themselves. These exit gates offer access indescrimintely to all guests to a presumably limitless number of pathways across dozens of timelines. However, finding these exit gates and determining where they lead can prove difficult. Library access is extremely limited among wanderers: only a few dozen from any specific timeline. Even then, wanderers may not have access to the Library throughout their lives. Entrance gates to the Library are also extremely rare and sought-after. The other extraordinary aspect of the Wanderers' Library is its self-contained timeline. Nothing exists outside the Library. There is no way to keep track of time inside the Library as its exists as a timeloop, and portions of the facility branch into unstable derivative timelines at random. It is ill advised for unexperienced or even intermediate travelers to enter this hub path as it is unpredictable and can result in time-loop entrapment, erasure, paradoxes, timeline splits, unpleasant encounters, and of course, death. However, the treasures of knowlege and access to distant universes held withing the Wanderers' Library draws even the most studious of travelers.
