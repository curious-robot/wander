location: Asia
history:
aesthetic: The Blinking Cat is an 8 foot tall, stone sculpture of a cat its eyes closed located in Hiroshima, Japan. Most travelers can use this gate, which is bounded by the surface of the stone.
specialty: This gate is most known for allowing travelers escape from the atomic bomb detonated above Hiroshima by the United States of America on August 6, 1945. Wanderers who find themselves in Hiroshima during the pathway's existence obviously must be desperate, and only a dozen or so travelers enter it, and only 2 recorded travelers exit from the Blinking Cat before the gate closes. The Blinking Cat is also known for its high volume of generated timelines, especially considering it exists for so short a time.
