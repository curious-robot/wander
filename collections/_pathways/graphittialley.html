history:
aesthetic: Miles Alley is an alleyway in downtown [WIP]. A specific section of the north wall denoted with elaborate graphitti is the boundary of the pathway. 
specialty: Miles Alley is a one way flow of traffic, accepting travelers from 3 locations and routing travelers to 1 of 2 locations. If the Charlettans' Wardrobe has Miles Alley selected on its destination knob, Miles Alley will offer access to the wardrobe. If the Charlettan's Wardrobe is set to a different destination, Miles Alley offers access to the Hephaestus Research Facility. This makes it one of the few unguarded entrances to the Facility.
